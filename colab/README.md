# Vocalysis Google Colab Notebook

This directory contains the Google Colab notebook implementation of the Vocalysis system, which analyzes voice patterns to detect mental health indicators.

## Usage

1. Upload the `Vocalysis_Mental_Health_Voice_Analysis.ipynb` file to Google Colab
2. Run all cells to install dependencies and initialize the system
3. Use the interactive interface to record audio or upload audio files for analysis
4. View the analysis results, including mental health classification, feature visualization, and diagnostic report

## Features

- Audio processing and validation
- Comprehensive feature extraction (time-domain, frequency-domain, prosodic)
- Neural network model for mental state classification
- Synthetic data generation for model training
- Clinical validation and interpretation
- Interactive user interface
- Diagnostic report generation

## Requirements

- Google Colab environment
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: librosa, torch, matplotlib, soundfile, etc. (installed automatically by the notebook)

## Note

This system is for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended to provide medical diagnosis or replace professional mental health evaluation.
